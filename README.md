A Home Assistant integration for Speidel Braumeister brewing systems via the My Speidel Cloud API. This integration allows you to monitor your Braumeister brewing process with real-time data and recipe information. It only works for Speidel Braumeister before the 2021 models at the moment.

## Features

| Pump Status | Current pump state (Ein/Aus - German for On/Off) |
| Heating Status | Current heating element state (Ein/Aus) |
| Process Status | Current brewing process status (running, idle, etc.) |
| Current Phase | Current brewing phase (Einmaischen, Rast, Kochen, etc.) |

### Binary Sensors

| Binary Sensors | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Alarm | Wird `AN`, wenn der Braumeister einen Alarmzustand erreicht (Einmaischtemperatur erreicht oder Rastende erreicht) |

### Recipe Information

The Brew Name sensor includes additional attributes:
- `recipe_slot` - Which device slot (0-4) the recipe is loaded from
- `recipe_matched` - Whether the recipe was found in your account
- `account_recipe_id` - The account recipe ID if matched
- `recipe_date` - Recipe creation date

### Translations

The integration includes translations for:
- 🇬🇧 English (default)
- 🇩🇪 German (Deutsch)

Sensor names are automatically displayed in your Home Assistant language.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)
Since this integration is not in the default HACS store, you need to add it as a custom repository:

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to Integrations
3. Click the ⋮ (three dots) menu in the top right corner
4. Select Custom repositories
5. In the Repository field, paste: https://github.com/omphteliba/ha-speidel-braumeister
6. In the Category dropdown, select Integration
7. Click Add
8. Now search for "Speidel Braumeister" and click on it
9. Click Download
10. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/speidel_braumeister` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Via UI (Recommended)

1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Speidel Braumeister"
4. Enter your My Speidel credentials:
   - **Username**: Your My Speidel account username
   - **Password**: Your My Speidel account password
5. Enter your Machine UUID (see below for how to find it)

## Finding Your Machine UUID

The Machine UUID is a unique identifier for your Braumeister device. The Speidel Cloud API uses a combined format.

### Method 1: From the My Speidel Web Interface HTML (Most Reliable)

1. Log in to [My Speidel](https://www.myspeidel.com)
2. Go to your Braumeister's control page
3. Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" or "Inspect"
4. Search for `data-machine=` or `var-device=` in the HTML
5. The full machine identifier is in this attribute

For example, if you find:
```html
<li class="teaser-box-item online" id="device_123" data-machine="1234567890ABCDEF.123" ...>
```

Then your Machine UUID is: **`1234567890ABCDEF.123`** (the full `data-machine` value)

### Method 2: From the URL

1. Log in to [My Speidel](https://www.myspeidel.com)
2. Navigate to your Braumeister's control page
3. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
4. The number at the end is the short ID

For example:
```
https://www.myspeidel.com/braumeister/control/123
```

The short ID is `123`. **However**, the API may require the full combined format. Use Method 1 to get the full identifier.

### Which UUID Format to Use?

The integration supports multiple UUID formats and will try them automatically:
- **Combined format** (recommended): `1234567890ABCDEF.123`
- **Short ID**: `123`
- **Long UUID**: `1234567890ABCDEF`

**We recommend using the combined format** from the `data-machine` or `var device` attribute for best results.

## Prerequisites

### My Speidel Account

You need a **My Speidel account** with your Braumeister registered. The integration uses XHR polling (the same method as the web interface) which works for all users without requiring a subscription.

### Device Requirements

- Speidel Braumeister (any model with WiFi capability)
- Device connected to your local WiFi network
- Device registered with My Speidel cloud service

## How It Works

### Data Fetching Priority

The integration uses multiple data sources for maximum reliability:

1. **XHR Polling (Primary)** - Same method used by the My Speidel web interface
2. **Device Info JSON** - Additional metadata (device type, mode, step, progress)
3. **Cloud API (Fallback)** - Historical data (may require subscription)

### XHR Polling

The integration polls the web interface endpoints to get real-time data:

- **Status Endpoint**: `/braumeister/getDeviceStatusControl/{device_id}`
- **Device Info**: `/braumeister/getDeviceStatus/{device_id}` (JSON with metadata)
- **Recipes**: `/braumeister/getDeviceRecipes/{machine_id}`
- **Account Recipes**: `/recipes/index/my_recipes`

### Recipe Matching

The integration automatically matches recipes stored on your Braumeister device (slots 0-4) with recipes in your My Speidel account:

1. **Exact match** - Recipe names match exactly (case-insensitive)
2. **Partial match** - Device recipe name is contained in account recipe name (e.g., "Low Rider Pale" matches "Low Rider Pale Ale")

This allows you to see the account recipe ID, creation date, and style for the currently brewing recipe.


## Troubleshooting

### Connection Status Shows "invalid_uuid"

This means the Machine UUID you entered is not recognized by the Speidel Cloud API. 

1. Verify the UUID by following the steps in the **Finding Your Machine UUID** section above
2. Make sure you're using the correct account (the same one you see your Braumeister in on the My Speidel website)

### Connection Status Shows "offline"

This means:
- The Braumeister exists in your account but is not currently sending data
- The device may be turned off or not actively brewing
- The device may not be connected to WiFi

Check that:
1. Your Braumeister is powered on
2. The device is connected to WiFi
3. You can see live data in the My Speidel app/website

### Sensors show "Unknown"

If sensors show "Unknown" after setup:
1. Check that your Braumeister is online in the My Speidel app
2. Verify your credentials are correct
3. Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
4. Try reloading the integration from Settings > Devices & Services

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for this integration, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.speidel_braumeister: debug
```
